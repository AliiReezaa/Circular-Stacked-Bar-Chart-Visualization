# Circular-Stacked-Bar-Chart-Visualization
## Project Overview
This project visualizes multi-category data using a circular stacked bar chart. The chart is created using **matplotlib**, and the data is sourced from an Excel file. The circular chart helps display the data in a more visually appealing way, with custom color gradients based on data values.

### Features:
- Read data from Excel.
- Customizable color mapping for data.
- Circular stacked bar chart layout.
- Easy-to-use and flexible for different datasets.

## Installation
To run this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

Add your own Excel file with the data you want to visualize. The first column should contain categories, and the first row should contain sector labels.
